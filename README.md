👋 Hi, I’m @antsteyer, a french guy and front-end engineer.

👀 I’m interested in front-end web development, accessibility and UI/UX.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects in Vue or javascript ecosystems

📫 How to reach me:
  - antoine.steyer@hey.com

⚡ Fun fact:
  - I still haven't finished Cyberpunk 2077 main campaign (but trying to take time for it !)
